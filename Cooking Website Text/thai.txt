        <p>Thai food is the national cuisine of Thailand.<br><br>
        Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge. Thai food demonstrates intricacy, attention to detail, texture, colour and taste.  The use of ingredients with medicinal benefits, as well as good flavour is also a characteristic of Thai cooking.<br><br>
        In 2017, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the "World's 50 Best Foods".  They were: tom yam goong (4th), pad Thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th) and Som Tum Pu Pla Ra (36th).<br><br>
        Thai cuisine is more accurately described as five regional cuisines, corresponding to the five main regions of Thailand: Bangkok, Central Thai, Isan or northeastern Thai, Northern Thai and Southern Thai.</p>
