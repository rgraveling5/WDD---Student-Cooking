    <h2 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Advice on Selecting a Wok to Buy</h2>
    <p>What type of wok should you buy?<br>
    There is no substitute for a good carbon steel wok. Not only is it relatively inexpensive, but it conducts heat evenly. If you are cooking with a electric hob, your best option is to use a flat bottom wok. Round bottom woks can reflect heat back on the element, damaging it. A flat-bottomed wok can also be used on gas stoves.<br><br>
        
    Handle, one or two?<br>
    Originally, woks came with two metal handles. Today, flat bottom woks normally have a long wooden handle, like a skillet. The long handle makes it easy to move and tilt the wok when stir-frying. One or two, it's up to you really.<br><br>

    Non-stick or not?<br>
    With the current interest in low-fat cooking, many manufacturers now offer woks with a non-stick coating. How well non-stick works will depend on the individual coating and how it is applied. However, in general non-stick coatings don't work well on carbon steel. If you want the non-stick coating, try a heavy gauge aluminum wok, such as those made by Calphalon.<br><br> 

    Choose a Wok With a Lid<br>
    A wok with a lid will make your life a lot easier especially when you cook Chinese food. A lot of time the ingredients need to simmer and be covered during cooking.</p>

        <h2>Taking care of your wok</h2>
        <p>Wash the wok in hot water with a small amount of liquid detergent and a scrubber. Do not use the abrasive cleanser on the inside of the wok.<br>Rinse the wok, dry thoroughly and then place the wok on high heat.<br>Move the wok, turning it and tilting it until the metal turns a blueish-yellowish color.<br>Remove the wok from the heat and turn the heat down to medium-low.<br>Add a thin film of oil over the entire inside surface of the wok with a paper towel.<br>Heat the wok on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes.<br>Wipe off the oil with another paper towel. There will be black residue on the towel.<br>Repeat the oil, heat and wipe steps until no black residue comes off on the paper (about 3 times).<br>The wok is now ready to use.</p>
